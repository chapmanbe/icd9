This is a Python implementation of some of the features of the R icd9
package.

ICD9 is version 9 of the "International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems".  See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD for more information.

All of the data components of the R icd9 package are included.  See
COPYRIGHT.txt for relevant copyright information.  The R script used
to prepare the JSON files distributed with this package is contained
in the resources subdirectory.

The package also includes a minimal set of icd9 format utilities.
